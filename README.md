# 🚀 ValeyEsports
This was my last and important project for High School. Well, ValeyEsports is constituted by: 
- **a Website** to allow the User create, manage and participate in eSports Tournaments;
- **a Mobile App** to allow the User see the tournaments that he participates without visiting the website;
- **a Raspberry Pi 4B** for register (in the systen) when a person enters and leaves from an event;
- **an API** to allow the communication between Mobile App and MySQL database.
