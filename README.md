This was my last and important project for High School. Well, ValeyEsports is constituted by: 
- **a Website** for create, manage and participate in eSports Tournaments;
- **a Mobile App** for user see the tournaments that he participates without going to website;
- **a Raspberry Pi 4B** for register when a person enters and leaves from an event;
- **an API** to mobile app comunicate with MySQL database.
